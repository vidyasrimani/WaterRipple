# WaterRipple
C++ computer graphics project using Open GL. Purpose to graphically mimic water ripples


This project is developed in C++ using OpenGl.
Aa I understand, C++ and openGL libraries are not the easiest to install.
To run this code follow the steps below.

Let's get C++ installed
-Both the installation and upgrade of Cygwin happen from the executable you download on the Cygwin download page.

I prefer the use of editors. I used Clion for the development of this project.
The packages that CLion needs are:

gcc-g++
make
GDB
Alternatively, you can just install the gcc-g++ and gcc-core packages. These two packages, make and GDB have all that CLion needs.
